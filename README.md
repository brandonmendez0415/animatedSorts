# Animated Sorting Algorithms
A collection of sorting algorithms animated in Processing.

This began as a way to solidify my understanding of QuickSort, but promptly turned into a small project I could make tangible progress in during short breaks in my schedule.

Below I've included GIFs of the animations I have created, and within you'll find the code used to accomplish this.

This was all done in Processing, a flexible software sketchbook and Java-based language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

## Animations

For the best quality please run the code in Processing
